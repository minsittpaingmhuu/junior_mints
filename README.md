# Junior Mints Football Club Website

## Overview

I created this as 1st Year University Final Project. This project implements a football club website using HTML,CSS,JS,PHP,Mailer and MySQL. I used pure JS and PHP to understand them more properly.

## Features

- `route`: Routing system.
- `admin dashboard`: Admin Dashboard for site and user management.
- `Password Reset`: Added Password Reset Features using PHP Mailer.

## Usage
```bash
   php -S localhost:5000
```

- The App is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Important Note

This project is a simplified example, and additional considerations such as security, scalability, and error handling should be addressed for production use.
